    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enhancement is the focus of content within a webpage, and the enchancment of the website using the basics (HTML, CSS, and Java).
        Another way to word progressive enchancement is the seperation of HTML, CSS, and Java. If the first basic step, markup, it not set up right,
        then the rest of the steps would not create a functioning website.
        The importantance of progressive enhancement is to create functioning websites without having to constantly maintain it, and to also
    check your work before continuing to the next step to making a website. </p>

    <h1>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h1>
    <p>Starting this project I had doubts since I have not taken HTML serious. Walking in this class I had high hopes to at least learn the basics of HTML format
        than other programming languages. The SpaceX assignment felt intimidating because how much CSS is involved, but it worked out fine. I had my close friend review my website.
        She said it is close to the target outcome, but it is made in my own way. She also implied to add the actual logo on the page, but I could not get it to work.
        There were also comments about how the basic look it not overwhelming to the basic user and easy to navigate through. She did notice my missing footer on my homepage. The revision I did 
        was go thorugh my HTML markup to create better structure for my pages, and to make CSS easier. I tried to add my footer back on my homepage, but it would not cooperate. I am satified with my outcome
        with this project, since I am really deep diving into web development.
